	My name is Michael Abeyta. I am 26 years old born and raised in southwest Denver, Colorado. I have a passion for coding despite being fairly new. I like having the flexibility to be creative but also technical when it comes to web development. I just started University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp and I am excited to be taking the first steps to increasing my professional value with something I truly enjoy learning about and doing. I currently work in administration for a company that optimizes shipping via software and equipment. The plan is to transition into the web development aspect of our business as soon as I finish school. I am thankful to work for a company that is assisting me in going back to school as well having a job waiting for me at the end of this journey.
